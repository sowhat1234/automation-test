# Automation Test

## Project Overview
This project is designed to automate interactions with the Facebook API. It consists of a backend service built using FastAPI and a frontend application using Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Architecture
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

## Backend Setup
The backend is structured using FastAPI, and the Python virtual environment has been set up with all necessary dependencies declared in `requirements.txt`.

### Key Files:
- `backend/requirements.txt`: Contains backend dependencies.
- `backend/src/main.py`: Main application entry point.

## Frontend Setup
The frontend is built using Next.js 15 integrated with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS.

### Key Implementations:
- Utilizes server-side rendering.
- Type checking with TypeScript.

## Project Structure
- `backend/`: Contains the FastAPI backend logic.
- `frontend/`: Houses the Next.js frontend code.

## Next Steps
- Integration with Facebook API.
- Core feature development for automation.
